To add 1st line as it is as in csv 1st line defines the column names.
In this program I will  check database exists or not. 
if not present then add it to database else ignore and set all values to initial values. 
Then I will check whether for a name family name is same or not in database, check whether l also check whether for a name gender is same or not in database.
if different gender are different for same name then other functions beneath are not called .
 Iâ€™ll run a loop untill input file reaches to eof, if input file reaches eof then exit from loop. 
Finally rite database into output file.current data doesn't exists in database.
